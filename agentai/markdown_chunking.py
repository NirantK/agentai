markdown_document = "# Intro \n\n    ## History \n\n Markdown[9] is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.[9] \n\n Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files. \n\n ## Rise and divergence \n\n As Markdown popularity grew rapidly, many Markdown implementations appeared, driven mostly by the need for \n\n additional features such as tables, footnotes, definition lists,[note 1] and Markdown inside HTML blocks. \n\n #### Standardization \n\n From 2012, a group of people, including Jeff Atwood and John MacFarlane, launched what Atwood characterised as a standardisation effort. \n\n ## Implementations \n\n Implementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen programming languages."
